             It's been nearly two years since Superman's (Henry Cavill)
colossal battle with Zod (Michael Shannon) devastated the city of
Metropolis. The loss of life and collateral damage left many feeling angry
and helpless, including crime-fighting billionaire Bruce Wayne (Ben
Affleck). Convinced that Superman is now a threat to humanity, Batman
embarks on a personal vendetta to end his reign on Earth, while the
conniving Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) launches his own crusade against the
Man of Steel.
